# Frontend for Decentral Goods
Decentral Goods is an online marketplace with decentralization at its core for secure payments. This was made as a project for "Solidity Cohort" an online course I attended about Solidity. The different libraries and tools I have used for the frontend are:
- NextJS + ReactJS
- Metamask Provider API
- EtherJS
- NodeJS
- Vercel (For Hosting)
